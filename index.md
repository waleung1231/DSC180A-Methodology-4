**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
This quarter, the most exciting thing for me was working with audio signals. I liked learning how to modify sound data, especially how different changes might vary the speed, pitch, or direction of playback. It was satisfying to connect sounds with how people interact with computers.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
I'd like to learn more about computer vision or possibly EEG signal analysis for my Quarter 2 project. I'm especially interested in finding out how to leverage real-time data from cameras or brainwave sensors to find patterns or control outside systems, like how I used hand motions in my current project.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
If I could alter one thing about how I'm doing things now, it would be to pay more attention to how different modules work together, especially how hand motion detection works with audio modification. To make quick changes to input more stable and provide users more precise control, I would introduce a filtering or averaging method.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I want to try out machine learning models like convolutional neural networks (for visual input) or recurrent neural networks (for time-series inputs like EEG or audio). I'm also interested in using signal filtering methods like moving averages or Kalman filters to cut down on noise and make the system more responsive in real time.
